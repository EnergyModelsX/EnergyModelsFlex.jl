`EnergyModelsFlex` is a package extending `EnergyModelsBase` with additional node types that capture different aspects of flexibility in energy systems.

> [!WARNING]
> The different node types are partly experimental.
> They have furthermore some limitations with respect to the chosen `TimeStructure` or whether they are able to handle investments.
> As a consequence, it is advised to read the documentation for each node to identify their usefulness.
>
> The initial version is based on [`EnergyModelsBase` v0.8](https://energymodelsx.github.io/EnergyModelsBase.jl/v0.8/).
> It is planned to update the model in the near future to support the latest version of `EnergyModelsBase`.
> This update may include the removal of some nodes and a rewrite of the behaviour of the different nodes.

## Usage

The usage of the package is best illustrated through the commented [`examples`](examples).
The examples are minimum working examples highlighting how the different nodes can be utilized.

Please refer to the *[documentation](https://energymodelsx.github.io/EnergyModelsFlex.jl/stable/)* for more details.
