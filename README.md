EnergyModelsFlex is a Julia package that extends the
[`EnergyModelsX`](https://github.com/EnergyModelsX)` energy system modeling
framework with additional node types that capture different aspects of
flexibility in energy systems.

This package provides a series of technology node types for `EnergyModelsX`
enabling energy and process flexibility modeling.

## Usage

See examples of usage of the package and a simple guide for running them in the folder [`examples`](examples).

Please refer to the [documentation](https://energymodelsx.github.io/EnergyModelsFlex.jl/stable/) for more details.

## Project Funding

EnergyModelsFlex was funded by [FLEX4FACT](https://flex4fact.eu/). FLEX4FACT is receiving funding from the European Unionâ€™s Horizon Europe research and innovation programme under grant agreement [101058657](https://doi.org/10.3030/101058657).
