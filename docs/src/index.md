## What is flexibility in energy systems?

Flexibility in energy systems refers to the ability to adapt generation, consumption, or conversion in response to variability in supply and demandâ€”especially with growing shares of intermittent renewable sources like wind and solar. Flexibility can be implemented in several forms:

 - **Temporal flexibility:** shifting electricity consumption or production across time (e.g. demand response, storage).

 - **Input flexibility:** using different fuels or resources to meet the same service (e.g. fuel-switching boilers).

 - **Operational flexibility:** including start-up/shutdown constraints, minimum running times, or part-load efficiency.

 - **Network and conversion flexibility:** controlling flows across interconnected energy carriers (e.g. heat and electricity).

**`EnergyModelsFlex`** introduces custom nodes that allow modelers to represent these dimensions of flexibility in a structured, modular way.

## Implemented flexible node types

This package provides several node types that extend the EnergyModelsX interface:

### Source Nodes

- [`PayAsProducedPPA`](@ref nodes-payasproducedppa): A source with contractual constraints typical for renewable power purchase agreements (PPA).

### Sink Nodes

- [`PeriodDemandSink`](@ref nodes-perioddemandsink): Allows demand to be met flexibly within a defined time period (e.g. daily energy use).
- [`LoadShiftingNode`](@ref nodes-loadshiftingnode): Supports discrete batch shifting across time within allowed work shifts.
- [`MultipleInputSink`](@ref nodes-multipleinputsink): Enables flexible use of multiple input resources to meet demand.
- [`BinaryMultipleInputSinkStrat`](@ref nodes-mul_in_sink_strat): Input choice from multiple fuels using binary (exclusive) decisions per period.
- [`ContinuousMultipleInputSinkStrat`](@ref nodes-mul_in_sink_strat): Allows input blending over strategic periods using continuous fractions.

### Network Nodes

- [`MinUpDownTimeNode`](@ref nodes-minupdowntimenode): Models units with startup/shutdown constraints and minimum uptime/downtime.
- [`ActivationCostNode`](@ref nodes-activationcostnode): Includes additional input costs on startup (e.g. ignition fuel).
- [`LimitedFlexibleInput`](@ref nodes-limitedflexibleinput): Restricts the share of individual input fuels in a multi-input conversion process.
- [`Combustion`](@ref nodes-combustion): Enforces full energy balances including residual heat losses.

### Storage

- [`StorageEfficiency`](@ref): Allows modeling of time- and state-dependent storage efficiency losses.
