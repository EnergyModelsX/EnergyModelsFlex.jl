# # [Flexible demand](@id examples-flexible_demand)
# This example uses the following two nodes from `EnergyModelsFlex`:
#  - [`PeriodDemandSink`](@ref nodes-perioddemandsink) to set a demand per day
#    instead of per operational period and
#  - [`MinUpDownTimeNode`](@ref nodes-minupdowntimenode) to force the production
#    to run for a minimum number of hours if it has first started, and be shut off
#    for a minimum number of hours if it has first stopped.

# - Note that the demand is only satisfied during the set workhours (6-20) on
#   weekdays. This is cause by the restrictions put on `PeriodDemandSink` with
#   the capacity limited to these time periods. This is also the reason that
#   there is no production during the weekend, even though the electricity
#   is free.
# - Also note that the production is always run for at least 8 hours, even
#   though the daily demand of 1500 units could be reached in 5 hours running at
#   full capacity. This can be explained by the constraint for minimum run time of 8
#   hours on the `MinUpDownTimeNode`. To maximize production at low prices, it
#   runs at the minimum capacity of 50 when the electricity is more expensive.
